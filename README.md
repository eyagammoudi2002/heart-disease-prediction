### Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Preventing heart diseases is crucial for public health. Data-driven systems can significantly enhance the prediction and prevention processes, enabling healthier lives. Machine Learning (ML) plays a key role in accurately predicting heart diseases.

This project involves:
- Analyzing a heart disease patient dataset.
- Preprocessing data.
- Training various ML models, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook code and dataset used in my Kaggle kernel, 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'.

### Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
- Support Vector Machine (Scikit-learn)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
- Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
- Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

### Accuracy
- Achieved 95% accuracy with Random Forest.
